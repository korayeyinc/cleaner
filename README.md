# cleaner
A simple Bash script for cleaning up redundant/duplicate files.
When run from the command line, the script produces report
about the most recent actions and saves the report to a log
file with a timestamp.


## Usage

First, add the directory names to "directories.txt".
And then, add the filenames to the "files.txt".
Finally, run the script in terminal as follows:

```sh
$ bash cleaner.sh
```
